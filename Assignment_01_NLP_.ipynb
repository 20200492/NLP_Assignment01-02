Regarded as one of the best players of his generation and among the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his clinical finishing, dribbling and speed.[6][7][8]\n",
            "\n",
            "Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon Al Arab, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016–17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists. In 2017, Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of £36.9 million. In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 UEFA Champions League final. Having formed a formidable attacking trio with Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané after the departure of Philippe Coutinho, Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and Premier League title successes in the following two seasons, and has since also won the FA Cup, EFL Cup and FA Community Shield. Salah has achieved numerous individual accolades, including two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards, three Premier League Golden Boots, the Premier League Player of the Season, the Premier League Playmaker of the Season, finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021, and finished fifth in the 2019 and 2022 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He received the 2018 FIFA Puskás Award for his winning strike in the first Merseyside derby of the 2017–18 season. In 2023, Salah became Liverpool's top Premier League goalscorer, and became the fifth player to score 200 goals for the club.\n",
            "\n",
            "At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament, 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Salah is regarded as a symbol of national pride in Egypt for his achievements[9][10] and was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in 2019.[11] Salah has also been credited for raising the profile of Liverpool among Egyptians.[12][13] To Egyptians, Salah is known as the \"Fourth Pyramid\".[14][15] Favoured across the Arab world, Salah is often known as the \"Pride of the Arabs\".[16][17]\n",
            "\n",
            "Salah started out playing for the youth setups of local teams Ittihad Basyoun and Othmason Tanta.[18] He names Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Francesco Totti as his childhood idols.[19] In 2006, he joined the youth team of Al Mokawloon Al Arab aged 14 after being spotted by a scout who had originally come to watch another child play but was distracted by Salah.[20][21] Salah frequently had to miss school to make the three-hour journey to training.[19] When Salah was 15 he was noticed by then first-team manager Mohamed Radwan, who moved him to the first-team squad immediately. Salah had to be given a special diet and training program due to his muscles not being fully formed because of his young age.[22]\n",
            "\n",
            "Salah made his first-team debut on 3 May 2010 in the Egyptian Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 away draw against El Mansoura.[citation needed] During the 2010–11 season Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.[20] Even though he was getting regular game time, Salah struggled to score. In the dressing room after matches he would sometimes be in tears because of this, and Radwan says it only motivated him to become better.[21] He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against Al Ahly.[23] He remained a regular for Al Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the 2011–12 season.[24][25] Following the Port Said Stadium riot on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March, the Egyptian Football Association announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.[26]\n",
            "\n",
            "Swiss Super League club Basel had been monitoring Salah for some time,[27] so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the Egypt national under-23 team.[28] The match took place on 16 March at the Stadion Rankhof in Basel, and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.[29] Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.[30][31][32] He initially found it difficult to settle, having arrived unable to speak the language and been signed as a replacement for Xherdan Shaqiri.[33] Salah scored on his unofficial debut on 23 June 2012 against FCSB during a friendly match, a 4–2 defeat.[34] He made his official Basel debut in a UEFA Champions League preliminary stage match against the Norwegian club Molde on 8 August, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute.[35] He made his league debut on 12 August against Thun, playing the full match.[36]\n",
            "\n",
            "He scored his first league goal a week later, the second goal in the 2–0 home win against Lausanne-Sport.[37] Salah scored his first UEFA Europa League goal in the quarter-finals on 11 April 2013, as Basel advanced to the semi-finals by beating Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in a penalty shoot-out after a 4–4 aggregate draw.[38] In the semi-final on 2 May, Salah scored away to Chelsea, although Basel were beaten 5–2 on aggregate.[39] Despite late disappointment in Europe, Basel won the 2012–13 Swiss Super League title[40] and finished runners-up in the Swiss Cup.[41]\n",
            "\n",
            "Ahead of the 2013–14 Swiss Super League season, Salah was a member of the Basel team that won the 2013 Uhrencup.[42] Salah scored in his first league appearance of the season against Aarau on 13 July 2013.[43] He scored his first Champions League goal a month later against Maccabi Tel Aviv on 6 August 2013 in the third qualifying round.[44] Salah was the subject of major controversy following the game, after he appeared to deliberately avoid shaking hands with the players of the Israeli club in both the home and away legs.[45]\n",
            "\n",
            "He scored twice against the Bulgarian league champions PFC Ludogorets Razgrad on 21 August 2013 in the play-off round.[46] On 18 September 2013, Salah scored the equaliser against Chelsea in the 2–1 away win during the group stage. During the return tie on 26 November at the St. Jakob-Park, Salah scored the winning goal as Basel beat Chelsea for the second time with a 1–0 home win.[47] However he was unable to prevent Basel being eliminated in the group stage.[48]\n",
            "\n",
            "On the domestic stage, Salah continued to perform. Scoring 4 goals in 18 games,[49] including a double against title rivals Young Boys,[50] he helped Basel win the league title for the fifth time in a row.[51]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 23 January 2014, it was announced that Salah would leave Basel.[52] During his time with the club, Salah played a total of 95 games for Basel scoring a total of 21 goals. 47 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, six in the Swiss Cup, 26 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and Europa League) and 16 were friendly games. He scored nine goals in the domestic league, four in the cup, seven in the European games and the other was scored during the test games.[53]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 23 January 2014, Premier League club Chelsea announced that a deal had been agreed with Basel to sign Salah for a fee reported to be in the region of £11 million.[54] Three days later the transfer was completed, making him the first Egyptian to sign for the London-based club.[55] Liverpool had been interested in Salah, and had made an offer of £11 million but were beaten to his signature by Chelsea.[56]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 8 February, Salah made his debut for Chelsea in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in the 3–0 win over Newcastle United.[57] Seven games later, on 22 March, Salah scored his first goal for Chelsea against Arsenal in the London Derby, coming on as a substitute for Oscar, in a match which ended as a 6–0 home win.[58] Then, on 5 April, Salah opened the scoring and later won a penalty and assisted the third goal in Chelsea's 3–0 win over Stoke City.[59]\n",
            "\n",
            "Before the 2014–15 season, Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in doubt after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education.[60] He was spared of military service after a meeting with the then Egyptian prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the Minister of Higher Education, and the Egypt national team manager Shawky Gharieb.[61] Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by Eden Hazard changing to number 10.[62]\n",
            "\n",
            "Salah was rarely used during the season, making just three Premier League, two Champions League and three cup appearances, failing to score in any of them. On 28 October 2014, after a poor performance in a 2–1 win away League Two team Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the League Cup, he and fellow winger André Schürrle were criticised publicly by manager José Mourinho.[63] Although Salah only made three league appearances before his loan move to Fiorentina, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica winner's medal from the club for his contributions that season.[64]\n",
            "\n",
            "On the transfer deadline day, 2 February 2015, Chelsea confirmed that Salah would join Italian club Fiorentina on an 18-month loan until the end of the 2015–16 season, as part of a transfer deal which saw Juan Cuadrado moving in the opposite direction. Six days after signing, he made his debut coming off the bench in the 65th minute as a replacement for Joaquín in a 3–2 home victory against Atalanta in Serie A.[65] Salah chose the number 74 shirt in honour of the victims of the Port Said Stadium riot.[66][67][68]\n",
            "\n",
            "Salah made his first start for Fiorentina on 14 February against Sassuolo, scoring his first goal for the club in the 30th minute. He then provided an assist to Khouma Babacar just two minutes after scoring; the match ended in a 3–1 win for Fiorentina.[69] Twelve days later, Salah scored his first European goal for Fiorentina, as his side advanced to the round of sixteen of the Europa League, beating Tottenham 3–1 on aggregate.[70][71] Salah scored the winning goal for Fiorentina against Inter Milan on 1 March, his third goal in Serie A.[72] Four days after that, Salah scored both of Fiorentina's goals in their 2–1 win away to Juventus in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg.[73] At the end of the season, Fiorentina activated an option to make the loan move permanent, but Salah refused the move. Even though the loan agreement was for 18 months, Salah refused to return to Fiorentina and instead joined fellow Serie A club Roma.[74][75] On 11 September, Fiorentina filed a complaint to FIFA, claiming that Chelsea had breached the agreed contract when they allowed Salah to join Roma on loan.[76] The Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Salah and Chelsea of any wrongdoing.[77]\n",

On his return, Salah was also sent off after picking up a second yellow in the closing minutes of the match, just seconds after picking up his first yellow.[86][87] On 4 November, he scored the opening goal of a 3–2 Champions League win over Bayer Leverkusen.[88]\n",

In this game, he also broke a record of scoring 36 times in his debut season for Liverpool, and also became the leading goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues – overtaking Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Tottenham striker Harry Kane.

His double also took him to 43 goals for the season across all competitions, surpassing Roger Hunt's tally of 42, and making him Liverpool's second-highest goalscorer in a single season, behind Ian Rush.[126] He had previously also broken the club's record for the Premier League era, surpassing Robbie Fowler's total of 36 goals set in the 1995–96 campaign, and Fernando Torres' record of 33 for the most goals by a Liverpool player in a debut season.[127] After his two goals and assists in the first leg against Roma, Salah featured in the second leg as Liverpool beat Roma 7–6 on aggregate to qualify for the final for the first time in eleven years.[128] He would then become the Premier League's all-time goalscorer for a 38-game season, registering his 32nd league goal in a 4–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion en route to being awarded the Premier League Golden Boot.[129]\n",

Mo Salah la-la-la la-ahh, The Egyptian King!\",[318] they also created another chant to the tune of Dodgy's \"Good Enough\", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam – \"If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too.\"[319] Salah has given his approval to the chant, and it has been cited as an example of inclusivity.[320] According to a 2021 study in the American Political Science Review, Salah's transfer to Liverpool led to a 16% reduction in hate crimes in the city, as well as reducing Islamophobic online rhetoric by Liverpool fans.[321] Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not, and his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK.[288] During his goal celebration, Salah lays in the prostrate position to thank God in sujud.[322]\n",

            "Salah is nicknamed \"The Pharaoh\" by the press and his fans.[323][324][325] He has also been given the nickname \"Egyptian King\" by Liverpool supporters,[326][327] arising from a chant set to the tune of \"Sit Down\" by English indie rock band James.[328]\n",

            "Following his goal that led Egypt to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1990, a school in Egypt was named after him.[329] Following Egypt's exit from the World Cup, Salah stayed in his home country for his pre-season holiday. In late June, his address was accidentally leaked on Facebook. After this, crowds of fans showed up at Salah's house, with Salah greeting the fans and signing autographs for some, although according to reports in Spain, police did arrive to cordon off his house.[330]\n",

            "During Liverpool's 2018 pre-season tour in the U.S., American artist Brandan Odums created a mural in the Times Square area displaying Salah in the Egypt kit, with the player later posting an image on social media posing next to it.[331][332] In Egypt, several murals have also been created displaying Salah's likeness, including one in the capital of Cairo.[333][334]\n",

            "A testament to his influence in the region and globally, Salah was featured on the cover of two major magazines in 2018: GQ Middle East (feature story titled \"The Unstoppable Rise of Mo Salah\")[335] and Time magazine's 2019 Time 100 edition.[336] An advocate of women's equality in the Middle East, Salah (in his Time 100 entry) states, \"We need to change the way we treat women in our culture\".[337] English comedian, and noted Liverpool fan, John Oliver wrote Salah's feature in the Time 100 issue.[336] Oliver notably started the feature writing \"Mo Salah is a better human being than he is a football player. And he's one of the best football players in the world.\"[338] Despite being named as the \"GQ Middle East Man of The Year\" in 2019, another GQ photoshoot, with Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio, caused him some criticism in the Islamic world.[339] In January 2020, it was announced that Salah would be honoured with a wax statue at Madame Tussauds in London.[340]\n",
